## üìä Stock Forecast API Integration

SalesMate integrates with Python FastAPI to predict products that will soon be out of stock on the Dashboard.

### Setup the Forecasting API:

1. **Install Python Libraries**:
   - Run `install_api_requirements.bat` to install necessary Python libraries

2. **Create Sample Prediction Models**:
   - Run `create_sample_models.bat` to generate sample prediction models

3. **Start the API**:
   - Run `start_api.bat` to launch the Python FastAPI on http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs

4. **Use with SalesMate**:
   - Launch SalesMate normally
   - The Dashboard will display "Products Running Low (AI Prediction)" using forecasts from the API

### Troubleshooting:

- If the API is unavailable, SalesMate will automatically fall back to simple database-based predictions
- If no model is found for a product, a rule-based prediction will be used
